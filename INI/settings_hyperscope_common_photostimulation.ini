; INI-file supports numeric, string and boolean keys
; sections are specified using: [<section name>]
; keys are specified using: <key name>=<key value>
; 
; keys will be read as numeric values (double float), except:
; if "Read Key (Double).vi" returns an error, then key will be read as a string
; if key name contains the expression "name", then key will be read as a string
; if key name ends with "path", the key will be read as a path
; if key value contains any of the expressions "FALSE","False","false","TRUE","True","true", then key will be read as a boolean
; if key value is numeric and key name contains the expression "boolean", then key will be read as a boolean
;

; for comments, start line with a semicolon

; This is the settings file for the Photostimulation Module; which needs to be read in by the Photostmulation module during startup.
; Note that this is differernt from the *.ini files read by SciScan (Galvo/Reso) which are specific to Scanners
